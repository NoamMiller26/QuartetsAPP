Each player gets cards, and on your turn, you ask another player for a specific card you need, but only from a set you already have at least one card of. If the player has it, they must give it to you, and you continue your turn. If they don’t, your turn ends. When you complete a set of four cards, place it in front of you. The game ends when all quartets are collected, and the player with the most sets wins. Listen carefully to what others ask — it can help you figure out which cards they have!";
